# Sabik - The Terminal Assistant 🧠💻

> **"Speed. Control. Focus."**  
> Sabik is your personal assistant designed to live in your terminal — built for makers who hate wasting time.

---

## 🚧 Status: Project Kickoff (May 2025)

This is the initial scaffold for **Sabik**, a blazing-fast, keyboard-first terminal assistant.

**Goal**: Create an intelligent, extensible assistant that helps you automate routine tasks, fetch useful information, and control your digital life — all from the command line.

---

## 🧠 Why Sabik?

Most assistants are:
- 🐌 Too slow
- 📱 GUI-heavy and distracting
- 🧩 Not developer-friendly
- 🔐 Data-invasive

Sabik is the opposite:
- ⚡ Terminal-first (CLI-only)
- 🧘 Minimal, fast, and distraction-free
- 🧱 Modular: You control what it can do
- 🔒 Local-first, privacy-respecting

---

## 🎯 Planned Features (MVP)

- ✅ Command parsing engine (natural language + aliases)
- ✅ Task manager (`add`, `done`, `list`, etc.)
- ✅ File launcher (`open`, `search`, `recent`)
- ✅ Web assistant (`weather`, `wiki`, `news`, etc.)
- ✅ Reminders / Timers
- ✅ Plugin system for extensibility

---

## 🔍 Tech Stack (Planned)

- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **CLI Framework**: `argparse` / `click`
- **Natural Language Parsing**: Custom rules + optional OpenAI integration
- **Plugin System**: Basic dynamic module loader

## 💡 Vision

Sabik is not a toy. It's a power tool.  
It should feel like an extension of your mind — fast, programmable, and always at your fingertips.
